dht integration:
- test GET peers on mainline dht (e.g. for arch)
- create trait Tracker that works for both http tracker and dht
- periodically announce given the interval of trait
- implement PORT msg and send it to newly connected peers
- migrate everything to this new trait


- Clean shutdown
- Alias u32, usize, etc to semantic names
- unit testing, debug_assertions
- refactor:
  - favor From<> implementations
  - use more of codec encode for handshake
-   Server commands:
    -   PAUSE, RESUME, REMOVE, CREATE
-   dream-cli, dream-server: communicate through IPC

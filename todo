- announce to tracker every 30 min
    - if we get new peers add them to peerset and connect
- make add_torrent over an mpsc
- create timer for choke algorithm:
    - every 10s determine new unchoke list
        - sort peers by DL speed avg of last 20 seconds and pick best 4
        - choke everyone else
    - every 30s evaluate current optimistic unchoke and perform new one
- upload block to peer implementation
- make sure our bitfield is up to date always
- read output directory to see which piece we already have
    - or if we're in "seeder state" meaning the whole file already exists
